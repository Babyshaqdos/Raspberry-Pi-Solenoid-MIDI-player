# Raspberry-Pi-Solenoid-MIDI-player

The goal of the project is to have a group of 7 solenoids placed directly atop a keyboard. The software will then read the MIDI file in
and determine the type of note that is being read, the software will then send an output voltage to the corresponding solenoid causing the solenoid to strike the key and produce the key.
