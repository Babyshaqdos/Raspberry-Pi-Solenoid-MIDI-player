# Raspberry-Pi-Solenoid-MIDI-player

The goal of the project is to have a group of 7 solenoids placed directly atop a keyboard. The software will then read the MIDI file in
and determine the type of note that is being read, the software will then send an output voltage to the corresponding GPIO port connected to the solenoid causing it to strike the key and produce the note. 


--Finished--
Finished this project on 4/23/19. After many unnsuccesful attempts to follow the attempts of prior engineers for this project, we decided to code everything from scratch. 
This was a major challenge as python was not a language I was entirely familiar with, however I learned a lot of very useful skills to apply in the future.
A video demonstration of the project can be seen at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6L6H1UyKqAao_gvqRHmYLIe9PPqIHDt/view?usp=sharing
